# You can store global configuration variables like API keys, environment-specific settings, or other sensitive information in environment variable files.
# Create .env files in your project's root directory (e.g., .env, .env.development, .env.production, etc.) and use a library like dotenv or vue-dotenv to load them into your Vue components.
# Ensure that you add these files to your .gitignore to keep sensitive information secure.
